# Database Connection Optimization Guide

## Issue: Slow Database Connection in SuperBank

If you're experiencing slow database connections when loading the SuperBank page, here are the optimizations that have been implemented and additional troubleshooting steps.

## Implemented Optimizations

### 1. AWS Client Configuration
- **Connection Timeout**: Reduced to 5 seconds
- **Request Timeout**: Set to 30 seconds
- **Keep-Alive**: Enabled for connection reuse
- **Retry Mode**: Adaptive retry with max 3 attempts
- **Connection Pooling**: Optimized for better performance

### 2. Streaming API Improvements
- **Batch Size**: Reduced from 100 to 50 items per request
- **Stream Delay**: Reduced from 10ms to 5ms between batches
- **Parallel Processing**: Banks are processed in parallel where possible
- **Error Handling**: Better error messages and recovery

### 3. Frontend Optimizations
- **Timeout Reduction**: Reduced from 5 minutes to 2 minutes
- **Retry Logic**: Faster retry attempts (1 second instead of 3)
- **Better Error Messages**: More specific error descriptions

## Troubleshooting Steps

### 1. Check Environment Variables
Ensure these environment variables are properly set:
```bash
AWS_REGION=your-region
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your-access-key
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your-secret-key
AWS_S3_BUCKET=your-bucket-name
```

### 2. Verify AWS Credentials
- Check if your AWS credentials have proper permissions
- Ensure the DynamoDB tables exist and are accessible
- Verify the AWS region is correct

### 3. Network Issues
- Check your internet connection
- If using VPN, try disconnecting temporarily
- Test with a different network if possible

### 4. DynamoDB Performance
- Check DynamoDB table capacity settings
- Monitor DynamoDB CloudWatch metrics
- Consider using DynamoDB Accelerator (DAX) for frequently accessed data

### 5. Application Logs
Check the browser console and server logs for specific error messages:
- Look for timeout errors
- Check for permission denied errors
- Monitor for network connectivity issues

## Performance Monitoring

### Browser Console
Open Developer Tools (F12) and check:
- Network tab for request timing
- Console tab for error messages
- Performance tab for bottlenecks

### Server Logs
Monitor your Next.js application logs for:
- Database connection errors
- Timeout messages
- Performance metrics

## Additional Optimizations

### 1. Use DynamoDB Indexes
If you have large datasets, consider adding Global Secondary Indexes (GSI) for frequently queried fields.

### 2. Implement Caching
Consider implementing Redis or in-memory caching for frequently accessed data.

### 3. Pagination
For very large datasets, implement proper pagination instead of loading all data at once.

### 4. Database Connection Pooling
The application now uses connection pooling to reuse connections efficiently.

## Expected Performance

After these optimizations:
- **Initial Connection**: Should complete within 5-10 seconds
- **Data Loading**: Should stream data progressively
- **Error Recovery**: Automatic retry with better error messages
- **Overall Experience**: Much faster and more responsive

## Support

If you continue to experience issues:
1. Check the browser console for specific error messages
2. Verify your AWS credentials and permissions
3. Test with a smaller dataset first
4. Contact support with specific error details
